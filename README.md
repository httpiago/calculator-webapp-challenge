# calculator-webapp-challenge

All programmers build a calculator app to train at some point in their career. Here's mine. ðŸ”¢

**REMEMBER: It's a challenge, try your best and don't look for help on the internet!**

## Roadmap

- Install Parcel, Redux, TypeScript and Less.
- Create buttons style with all possible states.
- Create the interface using CSS flexbox and grid.
- Create Redux logic (using [redux-actions](https://redux-actions.js.org/)).
- Resolve "[Expected behaviors](#expected-behaviors)" session items.
- Host on GitHub pages.
- Write the documentation.

## Expected behaviors:

- [ ] Allow use negative numbers.
- [ ] Allow use decimal numbers.
- [ ] Allow chain multiple calculations (5 + 5 - 2 * 4).
- [ ] Allow edit a number in the calculation chain.
- [ ] Allow prioritization of calculations using parentheses "(5 + 5) - 2".
- [ ] **Should be completely keyboard accessible!**
- [ ] **Should be accessible to screen readers for visually impaired!**
- [ ] Should save calculation history in memory and browser.
- [ ] Should be installable and work offline.
